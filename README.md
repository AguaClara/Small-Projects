# Small-Projects

Subteam Leads will each be responsible for completing a small project, this can be done as an individual or as a group depending on the amount of work required for the project. The purpose of these small projects is to improve the AguaClara team experience. These projects should not take more than 10 hours per person over the course of the semester, unless you would like to invest more time in them. The team leads have come up with some small project ideas that people can use or you can create your own. For more information on expectations and past projects that have been done, check out the wiki!



If any of the projects in the issues interest you or a group of you, please **comment your name** whenever you would like
